title: "Spatial and Temporal Skill Aggregation"
status: "Delivered"
category: "Analysis & Metrics"
summary: "Assess model performance by geographic region, time period, season, or any custom grouping to identify where and when a model performs well or poorly."

## Value Proposition

A single overall skill score can hide important patterns. A model might perform well on average but fail during storm events, in shallow areas, or during specific seasons. Skill aggregation lets managers and modellers break down performance by any relevant dimension — time, space, or custom categories — to understand exactly where model investments are paying off and where improvements are needed.

This supports informed decision-making about model deployment: for example, identifying that a model is reliable in summer but not winter directly informs operational planning.

## What This Enables

- **Temporal aggregation**: Assess skill by month, season, year, or custom time periods
- **Spatial aggregation**: Compute skill on a regular grid to produce spatial maps of model quality
- **Category-based grouping**: Group by custom attributes such as station type, basin, depth zone, or operational regime
- **Multi-level analysis**: Combine groupings (e.g., skill by station and season) for detailed performance breakdowns
- Produce skill maps and heatmaps that communicate spatial performance patterns at a glance

## Current Status

Delivered. Users can group skill results by time period, category, or geographic grid when running assessments.
