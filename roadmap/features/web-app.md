category: "Platform"
summary: "Browser-based interface for model skill assessment, accessible to users without Python experience."
---

## Value Proposition

ModelSkill's current workflow requires Python programming skills, which limits its audience to technical modellers. A web-based interface would make model validation accessible to project managers, clients, and domain experts who need to review model quality but do not write code.

This would broaden the user base, enable self-service model evaluation, and reduce the bottleneck of having skilled Python users produce every validation analysis.

## What This Enables

- Upload observation and model result files through a browser interface
- Run matching and skill assessment without writing any code
- Explore interactive scatter plots, time series, and skill tables in the browser
- Share validation results via URL with colleagues and clients
- Serve as a demonstration and onboarding tool for new ModelSkill users

## Current Status

Under consideration. No technical approach has been selected. Both rapid prototyping options and production-grade solutions are being evaluated. No implementation timeline has been set.
