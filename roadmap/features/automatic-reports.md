title: "Automatic Report Generation"
status: "Under Consideration"
category: "Visualization & Reporting"
summary: "Generate standardised model skill assessment reports in HTML, PDF, or PowerPoint from a single command."
---

## Value Proposition

Model validation is often documented in reports that follow a consistent structure: overview of data, skill tables, scatter plots, time series comparisons, and summary conclusions. Today, assembling these reports is a manual process that takes hours and introduces risk of copy-paste errors.

Automated report generation would reduce the time from completed analysis to delivered report from hours to minutes, improve consistency across projects, and free modellers to focus on interpretation rather than formatting.

## What This Enables

- Generate a complete validation report from a completed model-observation comparison with a single command
- Output to HTML (for web viewing), PDF (for formal deliverables), or PowerPoint (for presentations)
- Customise report templates to match organisational branding and structure
- Include all standard elements: data overview, skill tables, scatter plots, time series, spatial maps
- Support batch report generation for multi-scenario or multi-site assessments

## Current Status

Under consideration. Early thinking has explored integration with MS Word templates and web-based report generation. No implementation timeline has been set.
