summary: "Define domain-specific quality metrics that integrate fully into all skill tables and reports."

## Value Proposition

Different domains have different standards for what constitutes a good model. Coastal engineers may need scatter index, wastewater modellers may need peak timing error, and hydrologists may need specific flow duration curve metrics. Rather than being limited to a fixed set of statistics, ModelSkill allows organisations to define their own metrics and use them exactly like built-in ones.

This means teams can align model validation with their organisation's quality standards, regulatory requirements, or client-specific acceptance criteria — without any workarounds.

## What This Enables

- Define a new metric and make it available throughout ModelSkill with minimal setup
- Use custom metrics in all skill tables, aggregations, and reports alongside built-in metrics
- Share metric definitions across teams to ensure consistent evaluation standards
- Support both standard and directional (e.g., wind direction, wave direction) custom metrics

## Current Status

Delivered in ModelSkill v1.2. Custom metrics are defined once and automatically appear in all skill assessment results.
