"""Minimal reader for EPANET and SWMM ``.inp`` input files.

mikeio1d reads only the binary result formats, so the ``.inp`` that accompanies a
result file has to be parsed here. Both products use the same layout: bracketed
section headers, ``;``-prefixed comments (including the ``;;Name  Node1 ...``
column headers the products write), whitespace-delimited data rows, and blank
lines to ignore.

Only the sections modelskill needs are interpreted; everything else is kept as
raw fields for a caller to use, or ignored.

    ----------

    Returns
    -------
    dict[str, float]

        no length, so they are absent from the result rather than present with a

    ------

    Notes
    -----
    ``[PIPES]`` rows are ``ID Node1 Node2 Length Diameter Roughness ...``, so the
    length is the fourth field. The units are whatever the model declares in
