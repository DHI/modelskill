title: Comparing Directional Data (e.g. wind direction)
jupyter: python3
---


Comparing directional data is easy from version 1.0 if the quantity is defined as directional. This happens automatically if data is loaded from a dfs file with EUM unit in "degrees" or if loaded from a xarray dataset with attribute "units" set to "degrees". The quantity can also be created as directional manually by `ms.Quantity(..., is_directional=True)`.

In the below example, the EUM unit is "degrees".


```{python}
import modelskill as ms
import mikeio
```

```{python}
fn = "../data/wave_dir.dfs0"
ds = mikeio.read(fn)
ds
```

```{python}
cmp = ms.from_matched(ds, obs_item=3, mod_items=[2])
cmp
```

```{python}
cmp.quantity
```

Circular metrics are used to compare directional data if the quantity is defined as directional. 

```{python}
cmp.skill(metrics=["c_rmse","c_max_error"]).round(1)
```

```{python}
cmp.plot.timeseries(figsize=(8,5));
```

```{python}
cmp.plot.kde();   # note: the KDE estimate is not directional! (yet)
```

```{python}
cmp.plot.scatter();  # note: regression line and Q-Q are not shown 
```
