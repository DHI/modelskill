"""Describe a network's loader output as a plain, comparable dictionary.

The point of a snapshot is to pin down what the loader produces today, so the
same behaviour can be demanded of the module once it lives in mikeio1d (ADR-013).
Two constraints follow from that, and both matter:

* nothing here imports modelskill. :func:`describe` takes a network and returns
  built-in types, so this file moves to another repository with only its
  fixture-loading callers changed.
* nothing here records *how* the network was built. No constructor name reaches
  the output, so a snapshot taken through one entry point still matches when the
  entry points are reshaped.

Floats are rounded on the way in, since a snapshot is meant to be read in a
diff. Comparison is left to the caller, which can afford a tolerance the file
format cannot express.
