"""Plotting functions independent of the comparison module.

* `scatter` is a function that can be used to plot a scatter suitable for skill assessment, with a 1:1 line and a linear regression line.
* `wind_rose` is a function that can be used to plot a dual wind rose to compare two datasets of magnitudes and directions.
* `spatial_overview` is a function that can be used to plot a spatial overview of two datasets.
* `temporal_coverage` is a function that can be used to plot the temporal coverage of two datasets.
